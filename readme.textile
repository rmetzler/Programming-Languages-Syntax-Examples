h1. Hi!

There are more programming languages than we can count. To write decent tools
to handle them (especially syntax highlighters), we need lots of good,
advanced, crazy code examples to test against.

If you know a language, and have a piece of interesting code to share, please
fork this repository, add your code example, and make a pull request!

h2. Structure

is simple:

bc. /
  ruby/
    my-example.rb
    another.rb
  javascript/
    got-it.js
    justlikethis.js
  erlang/
    choose-good-names.erl
